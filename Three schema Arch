Goal  : to separate user application and the physical database
3 levels 
Internal level: 
describes the physical storage structure of the database -- describes the complete etails of stat storage and access paths


conceptual level : 
hides the detaild of the physical storage structure and focuses on describing entities , data types, relationaships , constraints etc


External level : 
describes the part of the data base that a user is intreasted in hides the rest of db 


DATA INDEPENDENCE: 
without data independence if you make any changes to the internal level then u hacve to chage the higher level too . 
but with data independance the change won't affect the external level 

data independance types 
logical d Indep: ability to change the conceptual scheme without changing the exteraal schemes or application programs .

physical data independance : ability to modify thre internal scheme without changing the conceptual scheme 
changes may be needed to improve performance
